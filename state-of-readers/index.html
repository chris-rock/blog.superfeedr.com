    <div style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em; margin-bottom: 20px"><img style="float:left; margin: -2px 3px 3px 0px" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30ce50678f0e934eaa6697425c59dd7?s=20" >By <a href="http://ouvre-boite.com">Julien</a>, on 14 Mar 2013</div>
<p>So <a href='http://googlereader.blogspot.fr/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html'>Google Reader is shutting down</a>. This is obviously worrisome, mostly because the <em>deprecation schedule is tight</em>. But this is also a great news because Google Reader stopped innovating 5 years ago and yet was still the most visible RSS reader out there.</p>

<p>When people said RSS was dead, a lot of them were just expressing the fact that Google Reader was a zombie.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, we had this post in the pipes for a couple weeks. The initial reason for it was to get an exhaustive overview of the many readers out there to convince them they should use <a href='https://www.subtome.com/'>SubToMe</a>, but this deserves another post.</p>

<p>There are actually <strong>a ton of readers</strong> and I&#8217;ll focus on the web ones, because the web is my thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> There is indeed a LOT of readers and I&#8217;ve been contacted by many people to add theres. Please, make sure you read the comments too as they include a bunch of other suggestions</p>

<h3 id='msgboy'>Msgboy</h3>
<img alt='Msgboy' src='../images/msgboy.png' style='float:left; margin: 10px' />
<p>First, I&#8217;d like to point Google Chrome users toward <a href='http://www.msgboy.com/index.html'>Msgboy</a> which is our own in-house attempt. It&#8217;s obviously plugged to Superfeedr (realtime FTW), and will only store your data in your browser.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also <a href='https://github.com/superfeedr/msgboy'>completely open source</a> and you can import your data from Google Reader :)</p>

<p>We hope to have a Firefox version very soon. Feel free to get in touch if you think you can help :)</p>

<h3 id='google_reader_and_the_google_reader_based_services'>Google Reader and the Google Reader based services</h3>

<p>By all counts Google reader is/was the most popular RSS Reader out there. What&#8217;s even more interesting is that many other services, like <a href='http://www.feedly.com/'>Feedly</a> relied on its API. It&#8217;s worth mentionning <a href='http://reederapp.com/'>Reeder</a> too. These services will have to find an alternative to Reader&#8217;s API, Superfeedr can help =)</p>

<h3 id='the_alternatives'>The alternatives</h3>

<p>In the past couple weeks, we have seen dozens of new initiatives in this area. Let&#8217;s do a quick summary.</p>

<h4 id='bloglovin'>Bloglovin</h4>

<p><a href='http://www.bloglovin.com/'>Bloglovin</a> is probably the <em>only popular reader outside of the tech crowd</em>. It&#8217;s UI is probably closer to the Tumblr dashboard and the popular tabs tells more about its userbase than anything else: fashion, scrapping, food&#8230;.</p>

<p>In other words, it&#8217;s the proof that you do not need to be a tech nerd to use and enjoy a feed reader.</p>

<h4 id='newsblur'>NewsBlur</h4>
<img alt='Msgboy' src='../images/newblur-stats.png' style='float:right; margin: 10px' />
<p><a href='http://www.newsblur.com/'>NewsBlur</a> is on the other side of the spectrum in terms of users: it&#8217;s a very advanced web reader which has been here for a couple years. We love the insight it gives in stories.</p>

<p>Its business model is clear (freemium), which makes it a viable alternative in the long run.</p>

<h4 id='the_old_reader'>The Old Reader</h4>

<p><a href='http://theoldreader.com/'>The old Reader</a> is a very recent readers. Its UI will sound familiar to anyone who&#8217;s been using Google Reader because, well it&#8217;s explicitly inspired from it. Yet, it does a very good job and this is one of my favorite attempts.</p>

<h4 id='feedspot'>Feedspot</h4>

<p><a href='http://feedspot.com/'>Feedspot</a> is another Google Reader looking alternative.</p>

<h4 id='netvibes'>Netvibes</h4>

<p><a href='http://www.netvibes.com/'>Netvibes</a> was the most popular reader a couple years back. Even though it <em>moved away from beeing a pure feed reader</em> a long time ago, it still offers these features and may be worth a look if you like its UI.</p>

<p>There are more, like <a href='http://feeds.qsensei.com/'>Feedbooster</a> that I&#8217;ve been either unable to use or which seem quite abandonned. I&#8217;d love to add to that list if you leave a link in the comments :)</p>

<h3 id='plaform_owned'>Plaform Owned</h3>

<h4 id='wordpresss_reader'>Wordpress&#8217;s Reader</h4>

<p><a href='http://wordpress.com/'>Wordpress.com</a> has a beautiful Reader, which works really well, and it&#8217;s federated, which means that <strong>you can subscribe to feeds from other sources/platforms</strong>, like say Tumblr. I wish though that it offered permanent URLs, so it could be used with <a href='https://www.subtome.com/'>SubToMe</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like very few people around me know about that reader though.</p>

<p>I wish other platforms (I&#8217;m looking at you <a href='http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard'>Tumblr</a>) which already offer some kind of reader, offered it in a federated way. <em>Why can&#8217;t I follow non-tumblr sites in my Tumblr?</em></p>

<h3 id='self_hosted'>Self Hosted</h3>

<h4 id='feedafever'>Feedafever</h4>

<p><a href='http://www.feedafever.com/'>Feedafever</a> is a beautiful self hosted platform. It sold with a $30 fee and then you can run it on your own server.</p>

<h4 id='netflixs_rss_reader'>Netflix&#8217;s RSS reader</h4>

<p><a href='http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/introducing-first-netflixoss-recipe-rss.html'>Netflix&#8217;s RSS reader</a> was released earlier this week by Netflix. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is a true product or just aimed at being a demo, but it may be worth a try!</p>

<h4 id='cartulary'>Cartulary</h4>

<p><a href='https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary'>Cartulary</a> is web reader developed by Dave Jones to be hosted on Amazon EC2.</p>

<h3 id='consuming_rss_in_other_ways'>Consuming RSS in other ways</h3>

<p>Who said you need a dedicated app to consume RSS feeds?</p>

<h4 id='ifttt'>IFTTT</h4>

<p><a href='https://ifttt.com/'>IFTTT</a> is my favorite web automation tool. It has a lot or RSS recipes which can ease your RSS consumption a lot! For example, <a href='https://ifttt.com/recipes/83992'>this recipe</a> will push the content of an RSS feed to you pocket account.</p>

<h4 id='blogtrottr'>Blogtrottr</h4>

<p><a href='http://blogtrottr.com/'>Blogtrottr</a> is an RSS to Email service. It allows you to subscribe to feeds and get email when they update. Simple, convenient for those who don&#8217;t susbcribe to more than a couple feeds and don&#8217;t want to use yet another service.</p>

<h4 id='notifixlite'>Notifixlite</h4>

<p><a href='http://notifixlite.appspot.com'>Notifixlite</a> is a simple RSS to IM service that <a href='http://superfeedr.com/'>we</a> created. Just subscribe to feeds from your chat client nad receive notifications when they update.</p>

<h3 id='will_google_be_back'>Will Google be back?</h3>

<p>One of Google&#8217;s argument being the end of Reader is the need for them to focus on less services. Google+ is probably one of the few things that Google wants to keep. When you think about it, <strong>Google+, like Facebook and Twitter are some kind of reader</strong>. You <del>subscribe</del> follow people or even brands, and then get to publish to your stream.</p>

<p>Now, I asked some Googlers why they would not allow (with the right UI, of course) people to follow RSS feeds in their Google+. The response was that Google already had an RSS reader: Google Reader. Well, not anymore. Maybe one day, RSS will come back to Google via Google+ ?</p>

<p><strong>Another theory is that Google is trying to make RSS irrelevant in order to &#8216;push&#8217; publishers toward Google+ as their main subscription channel.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> The readers below were added based on comments here and on social networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id='rolio'>Rolio</h4>

<p><a href='https://www.rolio.com/'>Rolio</a> is a simple web based RSS reader. It works great, and self updates when new stories are available.</p>

<h4 id='skimr'>Skimr</h4>

<p><a href='http://www.skimr.co/'>Skimr</a> is probably becoming my new favorite web based readers: a very simple UI, extremely readable on mobile devices.</p>

<h4 id='tiny_tiny_rss'>Tiny Tiny RSS</h4>

<p><a href='http://tt-rss.org/index.html'>Tiny Tiny RSS</a> is a reader that you need to install on your own server&#8230;</p>

<h4 id='rssminer'>RSSMiner</h4>

<p><a href='http://rssminer.net/'>RSSMiner</a> is a web based reader whose UI is very similar to Google Reader&#8217;s. It&#8217;s also quite fast. You can upvote and downvote each entry. <a href='https://github.com/shenfeng/rssminer'>Code is on Github</a>.</p>

<h4 id='bazqux'>BazQux</h4>

<p><a href='http://bazqux.com/'>BazQux</a> offers a UI very similar to Google. Reader&#8217;s. You&#8217;ll have to pay to keep using it after some time.</p>

<h4 id='gregarius'>Gregarius</h4>

<p><a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/gregarius/'>Gregarius</a>. Another feed reader that you&#8217;ll need to install (PHP) on your own server.</p>
