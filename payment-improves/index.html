    <div style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em; margin-bottom: 20px"><img style="float:left; margin: -2px 3px 3px 0px" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30ce50678f0e934eaa6697425c59dd7?s=20" >By <a href="http://ouvre-boite.com">Julien</a>, on 13 Sep 2010</div>
<p>It&#8217;s now a little over 2 months that we started charging our customers and, like we expected, we learnt a lot. The first thing that we learnt (but we hoped that too) is that we&#8217;re building a legit business. Without going much into details, we made enough revenues to cover our expenses during this period (and even more!), which gives a lot of new perspectives. However, the solution we started 2 months ago isn&#8217;t good enough, for several reasons.</p>
<h3>People don&#8217;t like Paypal</h3>
<p>This was actually the most frequent feedback : <em>how can I avoid using Paypal to pay you guys?</em> Today, we&#8217;re happy to introduce <strong>a new payment system</strong>, so you can directly use your credit card on our site. We use the <a href="http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/">Braintree</a> for the payment, as well as <a href="http://www.activemerchant.org/">ActiveMerchant</a> and it&#8217;s been a breeze to integrate, once we got accepted into the various programs :). Of course, Paypal&#8217;s fans, <em>can still use the Express Checkout</em> feature.</p>
<h3>Monthly payments, rather than upfront fees</h3>
<p>We found out that it wasn&#8217;t really easy to deal with &#8220;packages&#8221;. Some of our customers weren&#8217;t feeling very confident to pay for our services <em>upfront</em>. At the same time, it was a requirement by our payment gateway that we only take payments for services that were delivered. So we changed this. <strong>You will now be billed monthly</strong>. We keep track of what you&#8217;ve consumed, and, once a month, we send the bill.</p>
<h3>Our pricing is competitive&#8230; on high packages</h3>
<p>&#8230; But <em>not so much on small packages</em>. As a matter of facts, we barely sold our $50 package. So we decided to drop down the pricing a lot.<br />
When $50 used to get you 25,000 credits, you will now get 100,000 credits (4 times as much). When $300 used to get you 300,000 credits, you will now get 900,000 (3 times as much), and $1500 will get you 6.2M credits, vs. 3M previously. We also introduced a <a href="http://superfeedr.com/orders/new">simulator</a> so you have an idea of how much we will charge you. Your Account&#8217;s page also shows your current consumption and an estimate of the price by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We really want to thank all the customers who trusted us from the beginning and <strong>this new pricing is retro-active</strong>, which means that if you bought packages in the past, <strong>we granted you the extra credits to match this new pricing</strong>.</p>
<p>I also want to remind all of you that we introduced <a href="http://blog.superfeedr.com/feed-retrieving-and-status-improved/">many features in the past weeks</a> which can allow you to monitor your credits consumption more closely. Feel free to review them, and give us more feedback. We&#8217;re here to learn and help from you. For example, <em>did you know that we send you your credits balance with every PubSubHubbub notification</em>?</p>
