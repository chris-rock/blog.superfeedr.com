<p>With Google Reader gone and the recent privacy scandals, millions of faithful readers are now looking for alternatives <strong>to follow</strong> content. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of publishers are anxious about gaining subscribers - and control over the subscriptions which have been delegated to Twitter, Facebook or Google+. Luckily, dozens of new readers have been announced or launched.</p>

<h3 id='copycats_wont_grow_the_pie'>Copycats won&#8217;t grow the pie</h3>

<p>RSS is dead has been the motto of several tech publications (none of whom actually deleted their feeds&#8230; but that&#8217;s another story!). The truth is these people were right in the sense that RSS has seen <em>very little innovation</em>, because one player was incredibly dominant and no-one could really distinguish from it. Now, that player is gone, but if we only use new readers who provide the same experience, we&#8217;re probably not going to see this ecosystem explode again.</p>

<p>Yet, there are so many ways to consume feeds: <em>Email subscriptions</em> have been massively pushed by Wordpress for example, <a href='https://ifttt.com/recipes/search?q=RSS'>RSS recipes on IFTTT</a> also provide innovative alternatives. Did you know that <a href='https://flipboard.com/'>Flipboard</a> also relies heavily on RSS to show you content in a beautiful magazine format?</p>

<p>These are non-google-reader-like experiences: let&#8217;s get more of these to make the e<strong>cosystem stronger and more resilient</strong>.</p>

<h3 id='subscribing_is_hard'>Subscribing is hard</h3>

<p>Most popular blogs have links to both a Twitter account and an RSS feed. Say I want to subscribe using both tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For Twitter, it&#8217;s as easy as clicking the Twitter icon and hitting the follow button: done.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For RSS, I have first to &#8220;guess&#8221; (or rather hope) that there is a feed, since browsers now hide the infamous orange icon. I can then select the url of that tab and copy it. Then, open a new tab, go to the reader I chose to use and paste the url. Hopefully, that reader is smart enough to actually find the feed url from this page&#8217;s url. If not, I&#8217;m screwed anyway and I&#8217;ll have to look into the HTML code of the page!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is <strong>too complex</strong>. Once you factor in that many people have no idea what a feed is, what a url is, or even how to open a new tab. (which is evident after <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ'>you&#8217;ve seen this</a>), it&#8217;s quickly clear that only nerds can be expected to use feed readers in their current form.</p>

<p>What if we could provide a simple <em>follow</em> button that does the hard job of getting the right content and smartly sending it to their favorite feed-reading tool? We would probably see more adoption for readers, more subscribers to blogs or news sites, and a generally <strong>more informed internet</strong>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this button exists, and it&#8217;s called <a href='https://www.subtome.com/#/'>SubToMe</a>. It&#8217;s easy to install and works with most feed readers in a very simple and elegant way. If you have a blog, give it a try! (you can click on it at the bottom of this post too!)</p>

<h3 id='polling_xml_sucks'>Polling XML sucks</h3>

<p>Finally, (and this is the nerdiest part!), we can improve the way feed readers get content for their subscribers.</p>

<p>The &#8220;level 0&#8221; solution is to periodically <em>fetch each feed, parse it, diff it and hopefully find something new</em>. This is a huge waste of resources for the publishers and the subscribers as updates are not that frequent for most sites anyway. Unfortunately, decreasing the frequency also means a delay in content and is not acceptable either.</p>

<p>Open web solutions exist, like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubSubHubbub'>PubSubHubbub</a> or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud'>RSSCloud</a>: they just allow for updates to be pushed from the publisher to the subscriber in an elegant way without wasting resources.</p>

<p>The cherry on the cake? <a href='http://blog.superfeedr.com/pubsubhubbub-0-4/'>PubSubHubbub evolved</a> and is now able to work with any kind of data (not just RSS or Atom), <strong>opening the door to a JSON based syndication format</strong>. Of course, this will only happen if all publishers (big and small) agree on a common format to avoid the waste of creating custom consuming application for each of them.</p>

<p>Do you see other traps for the RSS ecosystem?</p>
