    <h2>The Non-Decision makers</h2>
    <div style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em; margin-bottom: 20px"><img style="float:left; margin: -2px 3px 3px 0px" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30ce50678f0e934eaa6697425c59dd7?s=20" >By <a href="http://ouvre-boite.com">Julien</a>, on 11 Nov 2009</div>
<p>Superfeedr is a very exciting venture. Yet, I am <strong>incredibly frustrated when I am waiting for someone else to make a decision</strong>, answer an email or write some code. You know who they are : <em>these partners, customers, providers, lawyers, venture capitalists</em>, etc&#8230; all these people you deal with and who take forever to make a decision. I claim <strong>they are the worst ennemies for entrepreneurs</strong>.</p>
<h3>They don&#8217;t want to make decisions</h3>
<p><strong>And they&#8217;re right</strong>. They&#8217;re not the ones taking risks. VCs don&#8217;t want to be wrong, so they&#8217;d rather say <em>maybe, later, not sure yet, I need to chat with my partners, when you have revenues</em>&#8230; than anything that would look like a commitment. Customers also don&#8217;t want to make a decision, because they don&#8217;t want to show you that you have a bargaining power, so they will keep you waiting. Even journalists don&#8217;t want to make a decision : they want to talk about what everybody else will talk. The problem is : they sometime have a hard time predicting that, so they&#8217;d rather wait for a few hints before going out with your story.</p>
<h3>Why no is better than maybe</h3>
<p>In France, there is a saying that states that &#8220;as long as there is life, there is hope&#8221;. I&#8217;d claim that <strong>more than hope, I want certitudes</strong>. <em>Entreprendre</em> is all about <em>making an assumption and test-proving it</em>, making another one and test-proving it, making a third one and test-proving it. I say &#8220;test-proof&#8221; and not &#8220;proof&#8221;, because in the end, <strong>it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you&#8217;re right or wrong</strong>. What matters is that, after the process, you <em>know</em> and you have less and less assumptions to make.</p>
<p>When somebody says &#8220;<em>maybe</em>&#8221;, &#8220;<em>later</em>&#8221;, &#8220;<em>we&#8217;ll do it</em>&#8221;&#8230; you don&#8217;t learn anything, because that <em>doesn&#8217;t prove anything</em>. When <strong>they say &#8220;No&#8221;, you know something</strong>.</p>
<h3>A few tips</h3>
<p>As an entrepreneur, you should always <strong>make decisions</strong>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama">Dala√Ø Lama</a> said : &#8220;<em><strong>When you lose, don&#8217;t loose the lesson</strong></em>&#8221;. The only thing an entrepreneur can lose, is actually the lesson. <strong>Make as many decisions as you want, and keep proving them right or wrong</strong>. If you wonder if A or B is better, don&#8217;t think too much : try, you&#8217;ll know.</p>
<p>You <strong>can spot non-decision makers pretty easily</strong> : they don&#8217;t answer your emails (or at least, not right away), they never commit to anything (even the smallest things), they keep using the future when they speak/write. <strong>One you spotted one, avoid him at any cost</strong>. It <em>doesn&#8217;t matter how hard you will try</em>, they will not help you. I wrote code, prepared scripts, documentation, how-tos&#8230; etc. If somebody isn&#8217;t making the decision to use your app, all this is useless.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every-time you meet <strong>anyone who is making even the slightest decisions about your product</strong> (like tweeting about it, registering, sending you an email&#8230; anything), you have to <strong>be very very responsive</strong>. Not only they will be great <em>advocates</em>, but since they make decisions, they will <em>help you learn much faster and understand things</em> that would have taken years for you to grasp. You almost have to scare them with your dedication!</p>
