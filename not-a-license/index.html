    <h2>PubSubHubbub is not a license</h2>
    <div style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em; margin-bottom: 20px"><img style="float:left; margin: -2px 3px 3px 0px" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30ce50678f0e934eaa6697425c59dd7?s=20" >By <a href="http://ouvre-boite.com">Julien</a>, on 17 Nov 2010</div>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_to_sell_50_of_all_tweets_for_360kyear_thro.php"><span class="caps">GNIP</span> and Twitter announced a deal where <span class="caps">GNIP</span> will be able to resell some of the Twitter data</a>. Twitter repeated several times that they didn&#8217;t want to use PubSubHubbub and <strong>prefered closed and proprietary solutions</strong>. I believe that, from the beginning, we were not clear enough that <strong>PubSubHubbub</strong> was <del>just</del> a technical protocol. It&#8217;s a mistake that I&#8217;m trying to repair now.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you&#8217;re a subscriber, implementing PubSubHubbub doesn&#8217;t mean that you will have access to any content and have the right to use this content in any way.</li>
	<li>Similarly, if you&#8217;re a publisher, making your content (or some of your content) available as PubSubHubbub doesn&#8217;t mean that you will grant any kind of license to your content and that you will allow anyone to do anything with it_.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is PubSubHubbub?</h3>
<p>It is just a <strong>technical protocol</strong>, which means that it only defines technical means of interaction between 2 services. It&#8217;s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard">open protocol</a>, which means that <strong>nobody owns it and nobody can ask you to stop using it</strong>, or can claim ownership over it. It also means that you can participate and try it make it better.</p>
<p>If (and only if!) the publisher agrees that the subscriber gets this content to do something specific, then, yes, they <del>can</del> should use PubSubHubbub for the technical aspects.</p>
<h3>It is not a license!</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.3.html">technical specification</a> <strong>does not specify</strong> if the publisher should make all its data available to anyone at any conditions. For example, one can imagine that a publisher only grants access to specific subscribers for specific resources. We could also imagine that a publisher charges for its content and will only allow subscriptions from subscribers who paid a fee. Finally, PubSubHubbub can also be used internally for private data that is not intended to ever leave a given private/closed network.</p>
<p>In any case, making your feed available via PubSubHubbub doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to make all of your content available as PubSubHubbub, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that you allow subscribers to do anything but subscribing. If you want to prevent them from re-publishing, you can certainly get them to agree to specific terms of usage which indicate this.</p>
<p>The net-neutrality debate has been raging, but it could almost be considered as an example of this : the technical and business layers are distinct and <strong>technical concerns should not govern business/legal concerns</strong>.</p>
<p>At Superfeedr, we do this by having a specific setting that <strong>allows any publisher to accept or deny a subscription</strong>. We do host some very private hubs that nobody can access, but a single identified 3rd party application.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>If you use Superfeedr subscriber&#8217;s services, you will have to pay for the notifications we send you. Yet, we use PubSubHubbub. <strong>It&#8217;s an open protocol, and we charge for its usage. Other PubSubHubbub providers could do this</strong>. Getting data thru the Superfeedr pipes doesn&#8217;t mean that you own the data or can even republish it. The publisher&#8217;s terms of service still apply!</p>
<p>You can also certainly define feeds with specific levels of access, and have different pricing for each of them. You can also define what subscriber can or can&#8217;t do with your content&#8230; etc.</p>
<p>If you only remembered one thing, it should be this one : PubSubHubbub solves a technical issue, nothing less, nothing more.</p>
